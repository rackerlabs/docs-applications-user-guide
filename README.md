Rackspace Cloud Application Services User Guide

Application services include:

* Cloud Monitoring
* Cloud Metrics
* Rackspace Auto Scale
* Rackspace Intelligence
* Cloud Queues
* Cloud Orchestration
* Cloud Backup

This repo is a place to collect ideas for future document development. 
When the Application Services User Guide exists, it'll resemble the Core Infrastructure User Guide at https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/infrastructure/.
